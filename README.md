# GeolocationFinder1
Finds Longitude/Latitude of any location on Earth

A Python script which reads a csv file, here `supermarkets.csv` having addresses of the locations and finds the longitude/latitude for the location, then outputs a new csv file which is `result.csv` here.
For the purpose, I have used `Geopy` module, which uses `OpenStreetMap` API.

### To run
- Run the script as `python3 main.py`
